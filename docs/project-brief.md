# Project Brief: Personal Portfolio Website

**Date:** January 6, 2026
**Version:** 1.0
**Author:** Analyst (Mary)

## 1. Executive Summary
**Concept:** A modern, responsive personal portfolio website designed to showcase the identity, skills, and work of a {Student/Developer/Designer}.
**Primary Goal:** To provide a professional online presence that converts visitors (recruiters, clients) into contacts via a clear call-to-action, while showcasing technical proficiency through case studies.
**Key Differentiator:** A minimal, clean aesthetic with high-quality interactions (dark mode, typing animations) without the clutter of a blog.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Recruiters/Hiring Managers:** Looking for quick access to skills, resume, and project proof.
*   **Potential Clients:** Looking for case studies and style validation.
*   **Collaborators:** Looking for technical compatibility (stack).

## 3. Problem Statement
**Current State:** The user lacks a centralized, professional platform to showcase their specific skill set and project history.
**Gap:** Generic resume formats do not allow for visual case studies or demonstration of frontend capabilities (like responsiveness and theming).
**Solution:** A custom-built, responsive web portfolio that serves as a living resume and project showcase.

## 4. MVP Scope
**In Scope (Core Sections):**
1.  **Hero Section:** Strong headline, subtext, CTA, and Typing Animation.
2.  **About Me:** Concise bio (studies, interests, tools, goals).
3.  **Projects:** Case study format (Problem → Solution → Tech → Result) with **Filtering System**.
4.  **Skills:** Categorized grid (Languages, Frameworks, Tools). No progress bars.
5.  **Experience:** Impact-based bullet points.
6.  **Certificates/Achievements:** Credibility markers.
7.  **Testimonials:** Slider component (placeholders allowed).
8.  **Contact:** Working form (email integration) and social links.
9.  **Footer:** Copyright and social links.
10. **Global Features:** Dark/Light Mode toggle, Responsive Design, "Download Resume" button.

**Out of Scope:**
*   **Blog/Articles Section:** Explicitly excluded.
*   **User Authentication/CMS:** Content will be static or config-based for MVP.

## 5. Technical Preferences & Constraints
*   **Platform:** Web (Responsive Mobile/Desktop).
*   **Style:** Minimal, clean, professional.
*   **Interactions:** Smooth, subtle animations.
*   **Architecture:** Static Site or SPA (Single Page Application) recommended for performance.
*   **Constraints:** No backend database required unless needed for form handling (can use EmailJS or Formspree).

## 6. Content Strategy (Drafting Guidance)
*   **Tone:** Professional but friendly.
*   **Hero:** "Hi, I'm {Name}. I am a {Role} specializing in {Skills}."
*   **Project Cards:** Focus on the *result* and *tech stack*.
*   **About:** Avoid long storytelling; keep it impact-focused.

## 7. Success Metrics
*   **Performance:** Lighthouse score > 90 (Performance, Accessibility, SEO).
*   **Responsiveness:** Flawless rendering on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
*   **Functionality:** Contact form successfully delivers emails; Dark mode persists preference.

### 🧱 **Elicitation & Next Steps**

To finalize this brief and move to the Product Manager (who will write the detailed Requirements Document), I need you to select an option:

1.  **Proceed as is:** We will keep the placeholders (`{Your Name}`, etc.) and you can fill them in during the coding phase.
2.  **Provide Details:** Reply with your **Name**, **Role**, and **Top 3 Skills**, and I will rewrite the specific "Content Strategy" section to be ready for the UX Designer.

**Please type `1` or `2` (with your details).**
