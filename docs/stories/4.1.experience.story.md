# Story 4.1: Build Experience Timeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Visitor,
**I want** to see a timeline of the developer's work experience,
**so that** I can assess their career progression and role capability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Experience data structure defined in `experience.json` (or strictly internal if small).
2. Vertical timeline layout.
3. Items alternate sides on desktop (optional, or just standard left-aligned with line).
4. Responsive: Stacked on mobile.
5. Content: Role, Company, Period, Description/Bullets.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Data Setup
  - [ ] Create `src/data/experience.json`.
  - [ ] Fields: `id`, `role`, `company`, `range`, `description` (array).
- [ ] Task 2: Create Timeline Component
  - [ ] Create `src/components/sections/Experience.jsx`.
  - [ ] Design vertical line (using `border-l` or absolute div).
  - [ ] Map through data and render items.
  - [ ] Use `Reveal` wrapper for sequential rendering.
- [ ] Task 3: Integration
  - [ ] Add to `App.jsx`.

## Dev Notes
- **Design**: A simple "left-border" timeline is often cleaner than a zig-zag center timeline for text-heavy content.
- **Mobile**: Ensure padding-left to accommodate the line.

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `src/components/sections/__tests__/Experience.test.jsx`
- **Standards**: Verify rendering of all items.
