# Story 1.4: Implement Footer with Social Links

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** A footer component with social links and copyright,
**so that** Users can find social media links and the site has a complete layout

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Footer with social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, Email)
2. Dynamic copyright year
3. Responsive layout
4. Integrated into Layout component

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create Social Data Config (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `src/data/socials.js` (or similar) to export social links
  - [ ] content: GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter (X), Email
- [ ] Task 2: Create Footer Component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `src/components/layout/Footer.jsx`
  - [ ] Implement responsive container (flex col on mobile, row on desktop)
  - [ ] Map through social links and render icons
  - [ ] Add copyright text with `new Date().getFullYear()`
  - [ ] Ensure links have `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security
- [ ] Task 3: Integrate into Layout (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Import `Footer` in `src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`
  - [ ] Render footer at the bottom of the page structure
- [ ] Task 4: Styling
  - [ ] Apply semantic colors (text-muted, etc.)
  - [ ] Ensure spacing is consistent with design system

## Dev Notes
- **Headless Pattern**: Keep content (links) separate from component logic [Source: docs/front-end-architecture.md#implementation-patterns]
- **Icons**: Use the standard icon set chosen in Story 1.2.
- **Accessibility**: Social links need `aria-label` (e.g., "Visit my GitHub profile").

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `src/components/layout/__tests__/Footer.test.jsx`
- **Standards**: Verify year is current. Verify links have correct attributes.
