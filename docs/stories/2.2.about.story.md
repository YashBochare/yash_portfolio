# Story 2.2: Build About Me Section

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** An about section with bio and profile image,
**so that** Visitors learn about my background and interests

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Two-column layout (image left, text right) on desktop
2. Stacked layout on mobile
3. Profile image with placeholder support
4. Bio text with placeholder content
5. Uses Reveal component for scroll animation

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create About Component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `src/components/sections/About.jsx`
  - [x] Use `Reveal` wrapper
  - [x] Grid layout: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`
- [x] Task 2: Implement Content (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Image column: Use `img` tag with responsive sizing (`w-full`, `rounded-lg`). Use `ui-avatars.com` as default src.
  - [x] Text column: Headline "About Me", 2-3 paragraphs of dummy text (Lorem Ipsum or placeholder bio).
  - [x] Style text with semantic colors (`text-muted` or similar).
- [x] Task 3: Integration
  - [x] Add `About` to `App.jsx`
  - [x] Add `id="about"` to the section for navbar scrolling

## Dev Notes
- **Placeholder**: Use `https://ui-avatars.com/api/?name=Your+Name&size=400&background=random` for instant visual feedback.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the image sits *above* text on mobile (standard flow) or below if preferred, but usually image first.
- **Styling**: Add some `gap` (e.g., `gap-8` or `gap-12`) between columns.

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `src/components/sections/__tests__/About.test.jsx`
- **Standards**: Verify layout classes for responsiveness.
