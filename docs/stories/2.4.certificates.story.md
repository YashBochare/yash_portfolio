# Story 2.4: Build Certificates/Achievements Section

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** A section showcasing certificates and achievements,
**so that** Visitors see my credentials and accomplishments

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Grid layout for certificate cards
2. Each card: image, title, issuer, date
3. Placeholder images acceptable
4. Responsive and dark mode support

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Define Data
  - [ ] Create `src/data/certificates.json` (optional, or keeping inside component if small, but JSON preferred for consistency)
  - [ ] Fields: `id`, `title`, `issuer`, `date`, `image`
- [ ] Task 2: Create Certificates Component (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `src/components/sections/Certificates.jsx`
  - [ ] Use `Reveal` wrapper
  - [ ] Grid layout
  - [ ] Card design: Image top, details bottom
  - [ ] Use `via.placeholder.com` for images
- [ ] Task 3: Integration
  - [ ] Add to `App.jsx` (optional section, maybe below Skills)

## Dev Notes
- **Optionality**: If user has no certs, this section might be hidden. Ensure it handles empty data gracefully or is easy to comment out.
- **Styling**: Consistent with Projects card (but maybe smaller).

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `src/components/sections/__tests__/Certificates.test.jsx`
- **Standards**: Verify rendering.
