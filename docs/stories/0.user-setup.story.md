# Story 0: User Pre-Development Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Portfolio Owner (User),
**I want** To prepare all necessary accounts, credentials, and content,
**so that** Development can proceed without blockers

## Acceptance Criteria
1. EmailJS account fully configured and tested
2. All three EmailJS credentials documented (Public Key, Service ID, Template ID)
3. Vercel account created and CLI authenticated
4. Content drafted or placeholder strategy decided
5. Assets prepared or placeholder strategy decided
6. `.env.local` content prepared for developer

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Email Service Setup (EmailJS)
  - [ ] Create account at https://www.emailjs.com/
  - [ ] Add New Service (e.g., Gmail) -> Save Service ID
  - [ ] Create Email Template -> Save Template ID
  - [ ] Get Public Key from Account Settings
  - [ ] Send a test email from dashboard to verify
- [ ] Task 2: Hosting Setup (Vercel)
  - [ ] Create account at https://vercel.com/
  - [ ] Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel` (optional, can deploy via Git)
  - [ ] Authenticate: `vercel login`
- [ ] Task 3: Content & Assets
  - [ ] Review `docs/content-templates.md` and draft Bio/Projects.
  - [ ] Review `docs/asset-preparation-guide.md` and decide on placeholders (UI Avatars) or real images.
- [x] Task 4: Credentials
  - [x] Create `.env.local` file in project root (or prepare keys to give to Dev Agent).
  - [x] Format:
    ```
    VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=...
    VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=...
    VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=...
    ```

## Dev Notes
- **Critical Blocker**: Story 4.3 (Contact Form) strictly depends on EmailJS credentials. Story 5.1 (Deployment) depends on Vercel account.
- **Role**: This story is for the **User** to execute, not the AI Developer Agent.

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: N/A
- **Standards**: User self-verification.
