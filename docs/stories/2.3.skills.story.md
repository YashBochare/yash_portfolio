# Story 2.3: Build Skills Grid

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** A categorized skills grid,
**so that** Visitors can see my technical capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `skills.json` data structure created
2. Skills categorized: Languages, Frameworks, Tools
3. Responsive grid layout (1-2-3 columns)
4. Skill cards with clean design
5. Uses Reveal component

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Define Data (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `src/data/skills.json`
  - [x] Structure: `{ languages: [], frameworks: [], tools: [] }`
  - [x] Populate with initial data
- [x] Task 2: Create Skills Component (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create `src/components/sections/Skills.jsx`
  - [x] Use `Reveal` wrapper
  - [x] Import data
  - [x] Map through categories
  - [x] For each category, render a sub-grid of skills
  - [x] Skill "Card": Simple pill or box design. Can use icons if available, otherwise text only for now.
- [x] Task 3: Integration
  - [x] Add `Skills` to `App.jsx` with `id="skills"` (or part of About, but usually separate)

## Dev Notes
- **Data Driven**: Strictly use the JSON file to populate the UI. [Source: docs/front-end-architecture.md#implementation-patterns]
- **Styling**: `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4`.
- **Icons**: If using `lucide-react` or similar, you *can* map string names to components, but it's complex. Text-only or simple SVGs are fine for MVP.

### Testing
- **Test File Location**: `src/components/sections/__tests__/Skills.test.jsx`
- **Standards**: Verify all categories render.
